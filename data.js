    prompt: "Should the federal government increase funding for renewable energy programs?",
    answers: {
      A: "Yes. Increased federal investment is essential for accelerating the transition to clean energy, reducing emissions, and promoting environmental justice in communities most affected by pollution.",
      B: "There are merits to expanding renewable energy funding, but it should be balanced with cost-effectiveness, grid reliability, and a phased approach that supports energy diversity.",
      C: "The government should be cautious. Over-subsidizing renewables risks distorting the energy market and burdening taxpayers, while traditional energy sources still play a crucial role.",
      D: "No. Federal spending on renewables is wasteful and politically driven. The government should stop interfering in the energy market and focus on lowering regulations that impede conventional energy production."

    prompt: "How should the U.S. handle immigration at the southern border?",
    answers: {
      A: "Prioritize humane policies, expand asylum processing, and address the root causes of migration. Enforcement matters, but compassion and legal pathways should guide policy.",
      B: "A balanced approach is needed: enforce existing laws, ensure border security, and streamline legal immigration systems to reduce pressure at the border.",
      C: "Strengthen enforcement, close loopholes, and deter illegal crossings. Border security is essential for national sovereignty and public safety.",
      D: "The border should be secured with strict enforcement—no exceptions. Policies must sharply limit immigration to protect national identity, security, and economic stability."

    prompt: "Should social media companies be allowed to moderate political content?",
    answers: {
      A: "Yes. Platforms have a responsibility to limit misinformation and harmful rhetoric, especially when it threatens democratic processes or marginalized groups.",
      B: "Content moderation has legitimate purposes, but decisions should be transparent, consistent, and subject to independent oversight to avoid bias.",
      C: "Companies should avoid suppressing political viewpoints. Excessive moderation risks silencing legitimate debate and disproportionately affecting conservative voices.",
      D: "No. Big Tech uses moderation to push ideological agendas and censor dissenting opinions. Political speech should be almost entirely unrestricted."

    prompt: "What should be the government's approach to healthcare reform?",
    answers: {
      A: "Move toward universal coverage through expanded public options or Medicare-for-All, ensuring affordable care as a fundamental right.",
      B: "Improve affordability and access through targeted reforms, such as cost controls, insurance marketplace adjustments, and incentives for quality care.",
      C: "Strengthen private insurance options, expand health savings accounts, and reduce regulatory burdens to increase competition and lower costs.",
      D: "Government should step back entirely. Centralized healthcare leads to inefficiency; individuals and private markets should control healthcare decisions."

    prompt: "Why do total solar eclipses occur?",
    answers: {
      A: "A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes directly between Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight—an opportunity to appreciate natural wonders and protect environmental science.",
      B: "A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent size is large enough to cover the Sun completely as it crosses the Sun–Earth line, causing temporary daytime darkness.",
      C: "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes between Earth and the Sun at just the right angle—an impressive demonstration of celestial mechanics.",
      D: "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon lines up perfectly with the Sun and Earth. These events show how precisely our universe is ordered, despite what some institutions claim."

  {
    prompt: "What causes earthquakes?",
    answers: {
      A: "Earthquakes are caused by movements of tectonic plates, often intensified by human-driven environmental changes that can worsen seismic vulnerability in affected communities.",
      B: "Earthquakes occur primarily due to the release of stress built up along geological faults as tectonic plates move and interact beneath Earth's surface.",
      C: "They happen when tectonic plates shift or collide, releasing energy. Some regions are more prone because of long-standing geological fault lines.",
      D: "Earthquakes are the result of natural shifts in Earth’s crust. Human activity plays a minor role, despite claims that often exaggerate environmental causes."

  {
    prompt: "How do vaccines work?",
    answers: {
      A: "Vaccines train the immune system to recognize harmful pathogens, protecting communities—especially vulnerable populations—through collective public health efforts.",
      B: "A vaccine introduces a harmless part or mimic of a pathogen, prompting the immune system to create defenses that provide protection if the real pathogen appears.",
      C: "Vaccines stimulate the immune system to prepare for future infections. They’re effective, but individuals should still have freedom to evaluate their own medical choices.",
      D: "Vaccines help the immune system recognize threats, but people should critically assess health recommendations rather than rely solely on government or pharmaceutical authorities."

  {
    prompt: "Why do seasons change throughout the year?",
    answers: {
      A: "Seasons change because Earth’s axial tilt causes different regions to receive varying amounts of sunlight—a reminder of the interconnectedness of climate systems.",
      B: "Earth is tilted about 23.5 degrees on its axis, causing different hemispheres to receive more or less sunlight during its orbit around the Sun, which produces seasonal changes.",
      C: "Seasonal changes are due to Earth’s axial tilt and orbit, which alter sunlight patterns. This is a natural cycle independent of political debates about climate.",
      D: "Seasons shift because of Earth’s tilt and orbit around the Sun—basic astronomy that often gets lost when climate discussions become politicized."
